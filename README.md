```

## Routes & Navigation

The application uses `react-router-dom` for client-side routing:

-   `/`: **Home** - Landing page with featured content.
-   `/products`: **Product List** - Searchable grid of all available products.
-   `/products/:id`: **Product Detail** - Individual product information.
-   `/cart`: **Cart** - Review selected items and total cost.
-   `/checkout`: **Checkout** - Finalize purchase (simulated).
-   `*`: **Error 404** - Custom error page for invalid routes.

## Lazy Loading & Code Splitting

To ensure optimal performance, this application utilizes **React.lazy** and **Suspense**. This means code is split into smaller bundles and loaded only when needed.

-   **Route-based Splitting**: Main pages like `ProductList`, `CartPage`, and `CheckoutPage` are lazy-loaded.
-   **Implementation**:
    ```javascript
    const ProductList = lazy(() => import('./components/ProductList'));
    // ...
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <ProductList />
    </Suspense>
    ```
-   **Benefit**: drastically reduces the initial bundle size, leading to faster page loads for the user.

## Components Overview

-   **Header**: Contains the logo, navigation links, search bar toggle (mobile), cart counter, and theme switch.
-   **ProductItem**: A reusable card component displaying product thumbnail, title, price, and rating.
-   **CartItem**: Manages individual items in the cart, allowing quantity adjustment and removal.
-   **Loading**: A custom animated loader displayed during data fetching or lazy loading transitions.
-   **Error**: A user-friendly error page that handles 404s and other route errors.

## State Management

Global state is managed using **Redux Toolkit**:

-   **Cart Slice**: Handles adding items, removing items, updating quantities, and clearing the cart.
-   **Search Slice**: Manages the global search query state to filter products across components.
-   **Custom Hooks**: `useFetch` is used for efficient API data retrieval with loading and error states.
